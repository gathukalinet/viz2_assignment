    "### Assignment Instructions: Setting Up a Streamlit Dashboard Project with Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to create a Streamlit dashboard project, initialize Git, create a GitHub repository, and deploy your dashboard. This will guide you through a full development and deployment workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: **Create a Project Folder**\n",
    "1. Create a folder on your local machine where you will store your project files:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir streamlit-dashboard\n",
    "   cd streamlit-dashboard\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: **Initialize the Folder as a Git Repository**\n",
    "1. Initialize Git in the folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git init\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: **Create a GitHub Repository**\n",
    "1. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository:\n",
    "   - Click on the `+` icon at the top-right corner and select \"New repository.\"\n",
    "   - Name the repository, e.g., `streamlit-dashboard`.\n",
    "   - Make sure to leave the \"Initialize this repository with a README\" **unchecked**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After creating the repository, you’ll see instructions for connecting the local repository to GitHub. Follow these steps:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-dashboard.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: **Create a Virtual Environment (venv)**\n",
    "1. Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m venv venv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   - On **Windows**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     source/Scripts/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - On **macOS/Linux**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: **Create a `.gitignore` File**\n",
    "1. In the root of your project folder, create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like the virtual environment and Python cache from Git:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch .gitignore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open `.gitignore` and add the following content:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   venv/\n",
    "   __pycache__/\n",
    "   .DS_Store\n",
    "   *.pyc\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: **Create `requirements.txt` File**\n",
    "1. Install the required libraries for the Streamlit project, including **Plotly**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install streamlit pandas plotly\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Freeze the dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: **Create the Python File for the Dashboard**\n",
    "1. Create a new Python file for your Streamlit dashboard:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   touch streamlit_dashboard.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the file and write the Python code for the dashboard using Plotly. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import streamlit as st\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "   import plotly.express as px\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Load the dataset\n",
    "   @st.cache\n",
    "   def load_data():\n",
    "       return pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "   data = load_data()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Simple Streamlit app using Plotly\n",
    "   st.title(\"Streamlit Dashboard with Plotly\")\n",
    "   st.write(\"This is a simple example dashboard with Plotly visualizations.\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   fig = px.line(data, x=\"year\", y=\"population\", color=\"sex\", title=\"Population Over Time\")\n",
    "   st.plotly_chart(fig)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: **Push the Project to GitHub**\n",
    "1. Stage and commit the changes:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git add .\n",
    "   git commit -m \"Initial commit with project setup\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Push the code to the GitHub repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git branch -M main\n",
    "   git push -u origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9: **Deploy the Streamlit Dashboard**\n",
    "1. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and log in with your GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deploy the app:\n",
    "   - Click on the \"New app\" button.\n",
    "   - Select the repository where you pushed the code.\n",
    "   - Specify the branch (e.g., `main`) and the file name of your dashboard script (`streamlit_dashboard.py`).\n",
    "   - Click \"Deploy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 10: **Make Updates and Push to GitHub**\n",
    "1. If you make any changes to your code, follow these steps to push updates:\n",
    "   - Stage the changes:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git add .\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Commit the changes:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Push the changes to GitHub:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git push\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your Streamlit app will automatically redeploy with the new changes.\n",
