# Unemployment and Education Levels in Kenya
This repository contains an assignment on Streamlit and plotly interdependence in creating and deploying dashboards.

## Description

This streamlit app displays the different visualizations for the unemployment and education data among the Kenyan youth (age 15-35) between 2015 and 2024

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* There was use of a virtual environment through
```
python venv venv
```
* Activate the venv through
```
source venv/Scripts/Activate
```
* create a git ignore file to handle the environment libraries by
```
touch .gitignore
```
* Open the gitignore file and type:
```
venv/
__pycache__/
   .DS_Store
   *.pyc
```
### Installing

* pip install pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and seaborn
* Create a requirement.txt file by:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


### Executing program

* Once cloned to your terminal, run the app:

```
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

## Help

* I had to pip install an nbformat version.
* I changed and used a working model of a requirements.txt file different from the one on pip freeze.
